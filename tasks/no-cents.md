# Task

Currently, the currency inputs accept decimals (cents),
but we want to restrict the input to whole numbers only (no cents).
The input should only accept positive integers, but the user should
be able to toggle between whole numbers and decimals in the settings screen.
The setting should be persisted, like the others.
