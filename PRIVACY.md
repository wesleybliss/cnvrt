# Privacy Policy for CNVRT

**Last updated:** November 4, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how your information is collected, used, and shared when you use the CNVRT application (the "App").

## Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:

### 1. Information You Provide

The App stores your preferences and settings locally on your device to personalize your experience. This includes settings like your preferred theme, language, and currency selections. This data is stored only on your device and is not transmitted to us.

### 2. Information Collected Automatically

*   **Crash Information:** If the App crashes, we use Firebase Crashlytics to collect a crash report. This report includes information about your device (such as the model and operating system version) and the state of the App at the time of the crash. This helps us diagnose and fix bugs. This feature is only active in the standard version of the app and is disabled in the FOSS version.

*   **IP Address:** When you use the App to fetch currency exchange rates or display an avatar, your IP address is sent to the respective service provider as part of the standard internet communication process. We do not store or log your IP address.

*   **Hashed Email Address:** To provide you with a unique user avatar, we generate a hash of your email address and send it to `api.multiavatar.com`. Your original email address is never transmitted or stored.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

*   Provide, maintain, and improve the App.
*   Diagnose and fix technical problems and crashes.
*   Personalize your experience by storing your settings locally.

## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services to operate the App:

*   **Firebase Crashlytics (Google):** For crash reporting. You can review their privacy policy at: [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)
*   **Vercel:** For hosting the currency exchange rate API. Your IP address is processed by Vercel when you fetch rates. You can review their privacy policy at: [https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy)
*   **Multiavatar:** For generating user avatars from a hashed email. Your IP address and the hashed email are processed by Multiavatar.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to help protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access. However, no electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy in the App.
